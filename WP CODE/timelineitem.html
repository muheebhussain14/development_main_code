    title_primary="Know why you're in the industry. What brought you to this path?"]It's important to know why you're doing what you're doing because if you don't have it clearly defined, your customer won't either. Take the time to physically write it
    down. What value are you providing to your customer? What sets you apart from your competition? Why did you get into the industry in the first place? Why is this important to you? Why are you passionate about health and wellness?[/woodmart_timeline_item][woodmart_timeline_item
    woodmart_css_id="6006e117c724b" title_secondary="Have a professional, well-made website. If you're not a website designer yourself, pay someone who is." content_secondary="This is crucial. Your website is your home base. It's where your potential
    customers are going to come looking for you, to learn about you, what you stand for, what you offer, where to find you, and so on. It is one of the most important interactions they have with your brand. If your website is poorly designed and difficult
    to navigate, not only will it show up poorly on search results, but it will also give your potential customers a bad first impression. Like they say, first impressions really are everything. Invest in a website that properly represents who you are
    to your potential customers. The truth is, unless you have experience in designing and running a website, it's best to intrust this important task to someone who is familiar with it."][/woodmart_timeline_item][woodmart_timeline_item woodmart_css_id="6006e14587133"
    title_primary="Use social media, and use it well."]Social media is a tool and your website is the toolbox. Tools are necessary and useful, each with its own function, but at the end of the day, the goal is for all of the tools to end up back in the
    toolbox. Each social media platform serves its own function, but ultimately the goal is to lead potential customers back to your website. Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook are great tools for relating over health and wellness with your potential customers.
    You can utilize these platforms to promote your brand image, communicate with your audience, relate to them, and educate them. Overall, be a resource for your audience, a place they want to come back to.[/woodmart_timeline_item][woodmart_timeline_item
    woodmart_css_id="6006e15f9dffd" title_secondary="Utilize the power of influencers." content_secondary="This is a great marketing tool for creating awareness for your health and wellness brand in ways that you yourself might not be able to achieve.
    It utilizes people who have a follower base that sees them as experts or trusted sources of information. If you can partner with someone to help educate and promote the benefits of your product or service, more people will be interested in trying
    out sad product or service."][/woodmart_timeline_item][woodmart_timeline_item woodmart_css_id="6006e17174339" title_primary="Relate to your potential customers with compelling content."]Use content that is interesting and beneficial to your audience.
    Use your imagination here, as long as you are providing relevant and useful information that helps market and promote your health and wellness brand image, this is where you can have some fun and get as creative as you'd like! Stream live videos:
    answer questions about health and wellness, provide workshops, show how to use a product, anything that could be valuable to your audience. Share case studies, infographics, blogs, visually appealing images, podcasts, newsletters, anything! Again,
    your imagination is the only limitation.[/woodmart_timeline_item][woodmart_timeline_item woodmart_css_id="6006e1869b266" title_secondary="Don't forget about email marketing." content_secondary="22% of people actually read your emails, which is great
    news! It means that this is another valuable way of sharing information and staying on the radar of potential or past customers. This is another great marketing tool for sharing updates on the health and wellness world, and it can be especially useful
    in maintaining a relationship with past customers."][/woodmart_timeline_item][woodmart_timeline_item woodmart_css_id="6006e19ca3ea3" title_primary="Utilize your clients."]Your past customers are a great marketing resource. Utilize them to help promote
    your image. You can utilize automated health and wellness marketing emails to follow up with your customers. Ask them to leave a quick review. A good review is always beneficial and you can share them on your website and social platforms to attract
    other customers.[/woodmart_timeline_item][/woodmart_timeline][/vc_column][/vc_row]
