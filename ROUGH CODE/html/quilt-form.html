When you fill out the custom quilt form and after an initial assessment of materials, I will provide a final quote for your custom quilt. The rest of the payment plus shipping is due before I ship the quilt to you.</p></div><div class="col-md-12 process-content-item"> <h4>Hand-stitching</h4> <p>Say Luv Studio quilts are mostly machine pieced but the quilting maybe machine stitched, hand-stitched, tied or in combination. The hand-stitching is perfectly imperfect but that is what we love about it: that it is big, bold, and hand-sewn by the maker’s own hand.</p><p>If you have any other questions, feel free to contact me for further discussion.
